Computer Science is an exciting area of study. I am curious about many of its domains. Some of them are Algorithms, Mathematics for Computer Science, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, and Artificial Intelligence. A Bytt could be a writing that explains a topic, a brief summary of a research paper, a code snippet for a problem or random experiences that are related to Computer Science in one way or the other.
