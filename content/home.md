_Computer Science is a ~~vast~~ vaaaast and an ~~awesome~~ aweeeesome area of study. I am interested in many of the domains that it offers. Some of my broader interest areas include Algorithms, Mathematics for Computer Science, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing and Artificial Intelligence. A Bytt could be a writing that explains a topic, a brief summary of a research paper, a code snippet for a problem or random experiences that are related to Computer Science in one way or the other._
