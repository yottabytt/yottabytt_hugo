Execution matters more than just thinking of what to do and devising ambitious plans.

I had a rough plan of doing something of this sort. But my laziness kept me 
postponing to do this. It's now more than 1.5 years since I thought of doing something like this. I am not doing justice to my thoughts. End of the day, It's all about competing with you and making yourself better. 

So, this is the _"challenge that I am imposing to myself"_. I have termed it as the __Bytt Bucket Challenge__.

__ByBuC__, the abbreviated form of the __By__tt __Bu__cket __C__hallenge, is something that runs in a seasonal format, each lasting for a period of 2-4 months.

In every ByBuC season, each episode (month) of the season is focused on one particular area within Computer Science, and I must oblige in delivering tangible outputs on any topic every week.

More than the tangible deliverables, the purpose is to test my time-management skills, ability to sustain the curiosity, self-motivation, and determination.
