As of now, I have planned to present four kinds of bytts. They are, <br/>

* Paper Bytts  - _Brief summaries of my learnings after reading research papers._
* Code Bytts   - _Solution programs and experimentation programs to a wide variety of CS problems._
* Topic Bytts  - _Explanation of some of the topics in CS that I am interested in._
* Random Bytts - _Things that are related to CS but does not fall in the above categories._
