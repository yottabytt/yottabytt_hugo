So, till this date (July 1, 2017), I was operating in the internet as _fool\_01_. _fool\_01_ was the handle in all of my web profiles. Few days back, I planned to make a move to a new name which I could use uniformly across all the websites related to Computer Science and Programming in the internet. Due to the domain name issues and few other reasons, from now on, I would be visible in the internet as _yottabytt_. I have changed the names in few of the sites and have created a new profile in the ones in which I was unable to change.

#### Now, what the hell is _yottabytt_ ?

[What is yotta ?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotta)


What is bytt ? In Swedish, it means [changed] (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bytt). In English, I am coining it in a way that, a _bytt_ could be a writing that explains a topic, a brief summary of a research paper, a code snippet for a problem or random experiences that are related to Computer Science in one way or the other.

I think, now you can get the meaning of _yotta + bytt = yottabytt_

Here are some of my profiles, which were active in the past but no further.
